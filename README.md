- Hi, I’m @cfalkenburg
- I’m interested in all sorts of things. I work for a small product design firm as a Mech E with very little coding experience! I love little projects that allow me to combine hardware and software in simple and effective ways.
- I’m currently learning how to not be such a noob at programming and follow some guidelines. I work mostly with Arduino and Raspberry Pi for platforms and I guess C++ for coding? 
- I'm currently working on projects surrounding medical devices and 
- I’m an avid surfer and climber and love to spend most of my time outside if I can!
- Reach me at c.falkenburg@goddardtech.com
